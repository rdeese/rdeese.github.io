<p>
  I'm a senior at <a href="http://hmc.edu/">Harvey Mudd College</a> in Claremont, CA, where I major in computer science. I work with C++, Objective C, Javascript, Python, power tools, wood, old bike parts, and cameras.</p>
<p>
  I'm interested in artificial life and machine learning, using technology to enhance our sense of space and location, and building a greener world. I'm originally from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Island,_Bronx">City Island</a> in New York City.
</p>
<p>
  In the past, I've done geophysics research at JPL, product management at Intuit, and full-stack web development at Amazon. I'm currently looking for a full-time job after I graduate from college in May.

<p>
  In my free time, I play American folk music with my wonderful partner Karen. I love sailing, backpacking, and riding my bike. I'm also casual photographer and downhill skateboarder.
