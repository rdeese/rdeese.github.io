<h2>Conway's Game of Life</h2>
<p>I wrote a <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ConwayCPU">pip package called ConwayCPU</a> that runs and displays a modified version of Conway's Game of Life. The rules are modified dynamically according to CPU load, such the automata visually reflect how busy your computer is.</p>
<h2>Urban Farming in Claremont, CA</h2>
<p>I helped start a 500 square foot urban garden at my house in 2013. The <a href="http://margies-farm.tumblr.com/archive">Margie's Farm</a> blog was where I detailed our adventures at the time.</p>
<h2>Geocaching Sounds with Georeverb</h2>
<p>Georeverb was another hackathon iOS app, and another collaboration with Sasha Heinen. Georeverb allowed users to make public audio recordings pinned to their current location. Recordings could be heard only from the location where they were made. Georeverb was on the App Store, but it failed to catch on, and we killed the servers because of cost. It still lives on <a href="https://github.com/sashalives/sound-geo-cache">Github</a>.
<h2>Asphalt, a Local DJ</h2>
<p>In 2013, my friend <a href="http://sashaheinen.com/">Sasha Heinen</a> and I worked together to create an iPhone app that uses SoundCloud to find and play music that was created near the user's current location. It's exciting to discover new music and have a tangible, spatial connection with the creator. Asphalt won the Claremont Colleges' Hackathon in Fall 2013. Get it for free on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/asphalt/id756410941">App Store</a>, or check it out on <a href="https://github.com/sashalives/roadtripdj">GitHub</a>.
<h2>Computational Geophysics</h2>
<p>Over two summers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, I composed gravity data collected by satellite and detailed models of the earth's crust into maps for geophysics research.</p>
