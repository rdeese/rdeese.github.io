<p>For three weeks starting in December, 2014, I visited India with a group of dear friends from college. We travelled down the western coast of the subcontinent, visiting New Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Kovalam, Cochin, and Trivandrum. I shot the better part of two rolls there, whenever I had the foresight to choose my little Rollei B35 over my iPhone.</p>
