<p>This roll was kicking around in one of my drawers for a few months before I finally got it developed. The pictures on it span a few months: a few of them are from the 2013 Hardly Strictly Bluegrass festival in San Francisco, and the rest are from my winter vacation that year, which took me to Taiwan and India.</p>
